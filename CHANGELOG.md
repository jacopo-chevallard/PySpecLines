## 0.1.5 (February 13, 2019)
  - Added example file for UV lines
  - Added option to show plot each time a line (or group of lines) are fitted
  - Added another JSON file example, showing how to fit multiple kinematic components. Note that components with the same initial width estimate will have their widths 'tied' together during the fitting
  - Can now fit multiple kinematic components along with multiple lines
  - Added further options: can decide how many iterations fit continuum-fit lines to perform; can add an estimate of the relative accuracy with which the continuum can be estimated, hence placing a lower 'floor' on the final errors; can plot with log y-axis
